# Pomify â€” Pomodoro PWA

Files: index.html, manifest.json, service-worker.js, icons/*

Deploy on Replit or Bolt.new: create a static project, paste these files, and set the server to serve static site (or use Replit's static site feature). Ensure HTTPS URL is public (required for PWAs/TWAs).

Packaging for Play Store: Use PWABuilder or Bubblewrap to convert PWA -> Android AAB/TWA (see instructions in the chat).

Ad/Monetization notes: Place AdMob placeholder in index.html (adBanner). For Play Store submission include a privacy policy URL (generate with suggested generators).
